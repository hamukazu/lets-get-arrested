# Lets-get-arrested project

In Japan, a 13 year old girl was apprehended by the police for sharing a link on social media that contained a link to a website with an endless loop of alerts created with JavaScript. It can be replicated with the following code:

        while (1) {
          alert("!");
        }

Somehow this is regarded as a "crime" in Japan. So let's be criminals and get arrested!

Let's all come together and enjoy a life of crime!

It's easy. Fork this project and branch it as gh-pages. That's it! After you are done it would be most effective to the cause if you share your url "http://youraccount.github.io/lets-get-arrested" on social media.

## Not arrested?

You can surrender yourself to the police.
